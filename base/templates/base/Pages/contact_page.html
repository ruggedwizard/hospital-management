        <p>Do the Following:</p>
        <p>Step 1:</p>
        <b>Take Temprature</b>
        <p>Temprature can be taken orally, rectally or under the armpit.</p>
        <p>A Person is typically considered feverish if oral temprature is above 100F(37.8 C) or temprature is above 99.5 F (37.5 C)</p>
        <p>A Temprature above normal but below 100.4 F (38 C) is sometimes considered a low-grade or mild fever</p>
        <p>It may mean that the body is responding to an infection. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Step 2:</p>
        <b>Treat Fever, if Necessary</b>
        <p>No treatment is necessary for a mild fever unless the person is uncomfortable. if the fever is 102 or higer</p>
        <p>Give an over-the-counter medicine such as <pre>Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)</pre> as directed on the label.</p>
        <p>Check with your doctor first if you have any medical conditions or other medicines.</p>
        <b>Warning Do Not Self Medicate!!</b>
        <br>
        <p>Bathing or spoinging in lukewarm water may bring the temprature down. do not use cold water or alcohol.</p>
        <p>Have the person wear light clothing and use a light cover or sheet -- over dressing can make body temprature go up. </p>

        <b>Give Liquids</b>
        <p>have the person drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated</p>
