                gender. Whenever the Patient comes up his information is stored freshly.

                separate sheet and at last they all are summed up.
            </li>

                Diagnosis information to patients is generally recorded on the document, which 
                contains Patient information. It is destroyed after some time period to decrease 
                the paper load in the office.
            </li>
